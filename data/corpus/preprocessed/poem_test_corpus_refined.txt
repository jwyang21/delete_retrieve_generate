the simple ,  easy terror .
i used to think that beauty is for the roses <end_with_no_punc>
that shuttles the world round and round <end_with_no_punc>
it hung as now its olive skeins aloft <end_with_no_punc>
you had scarcely the courage to glance back at her <end_with_no_punc>
this party ,  such a colourful spread <end_with_no_punc>
most of the time i would like to be  pragmatic ,  rational ,  but i desire <end_with_no_punc>
trail the last wind <end_with_no_punc>
let ,  by my specious name ,  no tyrants rise ,
knowing neither more nor less .
the eagle never lost so much time <end_with_no_punc>
as a proof of living ,  had to hold pre-printed banners .
and continually the struggle is for nothing at all <end_with_no_punc>
the body dead ,  the sprite had his desire ,
writing poem on about <end_with_no_punc>
well designed publicity by those who earn high pay .
once in a year .
has anyone ever simply asked what do we do it for ?
you don’t dare it is what you say <end_with_no_punc>
and before bring face in gypsum <end_with_no_punc>
one hopes they will enjoy the meal they share <end_with_no_punc>
and ran before ,  as harbinger of light ,
to ensure my own precious identity .
though we had our share of problems ,
and when he lists can often see her face ,
beyond the cape of hope ,  and now are past <end_with_no_punc>
thus what should merit most respect <end_with_no_punc>
to which the muses' sons are only heir ;
the tangled wood reminds me of your hair -
drunk am i from the charm of your love <end_with_no_punc>
their beauty dropped out of the loneliness <end_with_no_punc>
little girl or little boy ,
now i have only the nights that are .
point out the honours of succeeding peace ;
'but it knows any friend it has met once before :
a growing burden .  meanwhile war arose ,
down the rabbit hole <end_with_no_punc>
lost in thought ,  which i shouldn't do ,
superman won't melt but he might freeze in the winter <end_with_no_punc>
jumping from one star to another one with earth as junction ...
with not a friend to close his eyes .
we  smile  together ,
their fear of truth must never be told .
the perishing beasts of the field .
nobady knows you .  no .  but i sing of you .
be able to help those <end_with_no_punc>
because you are gone .
we moved so very imperceptibly <end_with_no_punc>
is not able to recognized you <end_with_no_punc>
a like dominion ;  and the midnight storm <end_with_no_punc>
stay home or roam ?
someone once told me <end_with_no_punc>
like some roots anchoring the same big tree .
to deck the bridale bowers .
find fit shelter and inherit <end_with_no_punc>
truly the soul returneth the body's loving <end_with_no_punc>
to feel ,  to touch ... be felt ,  be touched .
subtle he needs must be ,  who could seduce <end_with_no_punc>
dost thou remember sicily ?
i wish i just would have died .
never believe that verse a license knows <end_with_no_punc>
he licks the blood of the dead <end_with_no_punc>
where are the breasts ,  the scarlet wings ?   .   .   .   .
by a new fashion ,  or apparel's change ,
dogs bark in fear ,  howl hysteric outside my room <end_with_no_punc>
no time for grieving what was past .
whatever ,  a financial distress <end_with_no_punc>
by the time of fall .
and nothing works .  the outlooks grim .
and to that simple object appertains <end_with_no_punc>
turns short ,  determined to be first the next ;
in sunshine :  right across its track there lay ,
you would cease to be .
when did hinduism begin ?
who loved me forever .
down by the majestic theater ,
kept in that camp with ages varying <end_with_no_punc>
follow their ways of tendencies of expressions of laughter <end_with_no_punc>
i should feel it a long time ;
on the spot      just <end_with_no_punc>
no matter what your heart may say ,  god will lead you all the way .
only the eternal one is constant ,
is termed as freedom of women .
we could lose it <end_with_no_punc>
the fields of the night <end_with_no_punc>
and it couldn’t just be dismissed <end_with_no_punc>
waiting to be kissed <end_with_no_punc>
bloom as the myrtle ,  or the rose .
i ask nothing of you <end_with_no_punc>
its nature ,  when spilt ,  at last <end_with_no_punc>
thanks for being here ,  even though you're on the phone .
treasures of grace to them are giv'n ,
let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead <end_with_no_punc>
i plead with all you gods ,   by dawn's first light ?
a robin redbreast in a cage ,
that the world will still go on ,
were still standing around them <end_with_no_punc>
clueless is the transgender .
untenanting creation of its god .
the glitt'ring colours of the day are fled ;
and ,  like light salmacis ,  her body throws <end_with_no_punc>
from life to life ,  draw near .
'to thee and to thy race i give ;  as lords <end_with_no_punc>
and told her all was well again <end_with_no_punc>
he let me loose ,  and cried halloo !
whence wealth and life their best assurance draw .
i'll reread ,  understand with the light of the sun ,
more living flesh than sandal-wood ,
you are one of the <end_with_no_punc>
this confrontation was done .
of the sun or the first-born bird ?
their city ,  his temple ,  and his holy ark ,
spring in the air <end_with_no_punc>
to show his love ,  -- that's all that's in it ;
what matters then how low thy store ?
not the memories ,  the texts written in the language of the flat hills <end_with_no_punc>
lean and thin and pathetic .
that you mouth in passion ,  pain .
we load tools back in trailer <end_with_no_punc>
you left me with a heart of stone .
looking so pretty and <end_with_no_punc>
try it… !   !   !
as then ,  thy wonder-working hand ,
now i question myself instead <end_with_no_punc>
say not of beauty she is good ,
in worse living conditions any dog never kept .
sit .  feast on your life .
yet deep dark night turns to the light <end_with_no_punc>
you were the atlas of my world ,
in after days when grasses high <end_with_no_punc>
there is no way i’d like to be <end_with_no_punc>
a night of dreams is like a sad and jerking song .
you wouldn't have bedtimes .
then i would be smiling too .
replenished ,  and all these at thy command <end_with_no_punc>
his breast is dancing on the restless sea .
and it melts with the breeze .
which though far away ,  is still on my mind .
without a sound ,  without a fight <end_with_no_punc>
made us and tortures us ;  if we must pine ,
swirling about the ears on either side <end_with_no_punc>
i had stuck the cold barrel of a gun <end_with_no_punc>
none hold the light of life <end_with_no_punc>
book v ethandune :  the first stroke <end_with_no_punc>
and the drive to get more money <end_with_no_punc>
upon thy fortune shine ;
to hide a new vision from you .
i would pull out the beauties that <end_with_no_punc>
and trace the hare i' th' treacherous snow :
after all my wife is my greatest find    ( italian sonnet )
shrouds are what we're buying <end_with_no_punc>
he had but killed a thing that lived ,
when springs run low ,  and on the brooks ,
which is brighter than the sun :
plastic bags .  they presented the lake with hours of human <end_with_no_punc>
and give and take .
where something is up ,
if you fail to grasp love <end_with_no_punc>
when i think about it <end_with_no_punc>
you must have been sent to me from above <end_with_no_punc>
closer to the compound wall inner side !
if adam aught perhaps might interpose ;
is nothing but a dream !
held reigns are best .   the child plays obliviously .
and so many people to meet ,
and even battered himself for the undeserved .
and here i am groping to get my way back <end_with_no_punc>
whose simple lives ,  complete and without flaw ,
no wonder all who’ve seen the place are bound <end_with_no_punc>
just an idle threat .
in such an inexplicable blue <end_with_no_punc>
bed "  and you admire the way <end_with_no_punc>
a man lives in the house he plays with the serpents <end_with_no_punc>
where against hardship we both dare to win <end_with_no_punc>
for as flaumbe is but lighted smoke ,
your behavior keeps me so confused <end_with_no_punc>
of expansion      we make of the earth ,
or fear the time they shall – <end_with_no_punc>
no voice says  " my mother "  again to me .  what  !
and for the north did pine ,
while he leaves his family behind <end_with_no_punc>
machines and humans form union <end_with_no_punc>
and yet in letters hath he skill ,
within his sacred chest ,
what other choice do we have ?
she is blown aloft on wind ,  i catch at leaves ,
i went to a funeral of a friend <end_with_no_punc>
for the exact same job as a woman <end_with_no_punc>
send the knight to prison straight .
safe from the weather !
let's pray for them .
wrought by the tenderest of hands :
make the world better <end_with_no_punc>
he trusted to have equalled the most high ,
to refrain my soul from sin ,
a thought of the lord ,
back to the covert of the willow tree ;
she knows in her heart that the lies <end_with_no_punc>
no room for saints <end_with_no_punc>
a different person from what i'd been ,
of old habiliments ,  each sort and size ,
of the roots here and there .
to merely touch your wrist !
to this uproar ;  horrid confusion heaped <end_with_no_punc>
and from her lips it seems there moves a gracious <end_with_no_punc>
whose son made devil his master <end_with_no_punc>
and then there are days ,  they all go away <end_with_no_punc>
though she which did inanimate and fill <end_with_no_punc>
in times of need he is there <end_with_no_punc>
are purest of love's gems .  "  a ruby key ,
it was your own affair .

is like a car without the gas ,  that love is going nowhere <end_with_no_punc>
and his thoughts before the monarchs thus in weighty accents laid :
she quivered ,  but she knew that he would speak <end_with_no_punc>
my head reclined at last ;
and the bridle upon his mane .
among the accursed ,  that withered all their strength ,
enlightenment falls upon me ,  from emotional release <end_with_no_punc>
your coy heart convince ;
the days in mallorca were alike :
as if with pleasure gleam'd each well-known star ,
or who fulfil it but a god ?
save what the glimmering of these livid flames <end_with_no_punc>
but at least he can enjoy <end_with_no_punc>
fire of the dragon’s heart <end_with_no_punc>
and around me the feet of thy watchers tread .
some sidled up the stairs :
in woods ,  on mountains cold ,
you are the moon up in my sky <end_with_no_punc>
i wrote about the poverty in poetry <end_with_no_punc>
has made me sick of you <end_with_no_punc>
loss can be good for us ,
now you are noisy ,  poor country <end_with_no_punc>
but would abstain after they realized it was now dry <end_with_no_punc>
he loves thee . ” then she touches a sweet string <end_with_no_punc>
and a chronic state of wet in your feet ,
we stopped at the place where they buried people ,
throughout the world some are ill <end_with_no_punc>
for luck shook it deadpanned <end_with_no_punc>
not in some foul sty . '
and it's sixteen miles to that home of mine--
then it is not hard to find <end_with_no_punc>
thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears .
freedoms four he saw ,  that here ,  - from fear -
whining aloud the name of the prophet ;
without you here with me <end_with_no_punc>
the preparations and the cooking ;
god grant a blessing on this tower and cottage <end_with_no_punc>
since the day we met - now and forever -
and it's i perceive ,
our homeward march was labour in vain ,
even with a stalk <end_with_no_punc>
and try to keep us down .
your image ,  in public eyes ,  gets it stronger <end_with_no_punc>
culture of light is eternal and infinite .
full of brownish foam bubbles .
when ,  from nights of restless tossing ,
a bald man ,  tall and careful ,
and now ,  good friends ,  since you see how it ends ,
things ,  beings they ruin <end_with_no_punc>
curse the sad fortune that detains thy fair ;
give awful joy ;  'tis paradise to look <end_with_no_punc>
i'd do anything to get better ,  except sell my soul <end_with_no_punc>
quit serious from college life romantically enjoyed !
be happy then ,  while yet you have to live ;
i remember being treated for free barbecue <end_with_no_punc>
now we had arranged ,  through notes exchanged <end_with_no_punc>
why men choose easy routes ?
she's just a teenage girl ,  does she know any better ?
the old don’t pass down knowledge <end_with_no_punc>
i know my leaving in the breakfast table mess .
i am not nurtured ,
if you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend ,  i demand as <end_with_no_punc>
tonight over the sea there are small lights ,
en plein air i sense warming comfort in the woods .
kids picking up shells and building stormy sand castles <end_with_no_punc>
and reach to the north and reach to the south <end_with_no_punc>
and a new beginning is forged .
its funny how hello is alway accompanied with goodbye ,
is what i hope for and miss .
and off we go ,  skipping lightly ,
it will pass on to its long way <end_with_no_punc>
on up the sea slant ,
far from these tracks my honest lays aspire ,
if this be error ,  and another faith <end_with_no_punc>
the god ,  not we ,  the poem makes ;
when i climbed up on the chair .
and the great dragon strongly doth repress ,
poetry readings have to be some of the saddest <end_with_no_punc>
my son when i hear you cry i wanna run over and hold you <end_with_no_punc>
i heard the poor old woman say :
what but rank folly ,  for thy curse decreed ,
the boers were surrounded while the enemy <end_with_no_punc>
from the sun's beam meet night ,  her other part <end_with_no_punc>
he is not gentle ,  though he riche seem ,
that any time expires ;
when i argue with my sister <end_with_no_punc>
and the thoughts of youth are long ,  long thoughts .  "
as bumble bee of june .
any signs and words of forgiveness are welcome <end_with_no_punc>
our hearts caught from thine eyes ,  thou shining one .
christmas is in sharing ;
where thickest boughs roof over <end_with_no_punc>
was the county fair <end_with_no_punc>
as i drift toward the light .
so as to have more <end_with_no_punc>
an angel awaits her knight in gloom ,
i realize you're only what i hold dear ,
shone straightway down that leafy lane ,
at one time ,  they were hunted by the system <end_with_no_punc>
came ,  and ,  as now with open eyes he lay ,
these men of great rakishness ,
lost you ,  lost everything ,
the work which his goodness began ,  the arm of his strength will complete ;
o storm and gale of tears ,  whose blinding screen <end_with_no_punc>
huge wave crashing red lighthouse <end_with_no_punc>
backed by the emotions--blind--
he spoke ,  but found you could not understand him--
and he’ll look with his sad little eyes <end_with_no_punc>
but in her small ,  dull paradise ,
when he is being extra good and calm .
when i cry she wipes away the tears <end_with_no_punc>
as you ,  may have their fill of meat .
who would make you servile ,  despised ,  and weak ,
to fantasy rhyme calls on cue !
among the foamdrops of the sea ,
twenty-four hours a day <end_with_no_punc>
she loosd her lace  &  cast a knot <end_with_no_punc>
the greatest curse since man had birth ,
our souls are light ;  they have shaken a burden of hours  .   .   .
when she sat at joseph’s hand ,
beautiful paris !  sacred to our hearts ,
but whoso may ,  thrice happy man him hold ,
environment is getting polluted .
whom pitying heav'n sends from their native skies <end_with_no_punc>
thanks for the hearts small and large <end_with_no_punc>
that the feast might be more joyous ,
and in solving others' problems i find solutions to my own <end_with_no_punc>
racism is the deadliest form of cancer <end_with_no_punc>
those flares where the sun hits them .
and i see her crying once again .
their hearts would be like a cup <end_with_no_punc>
the moon and the sun and the sea the rain and the wind ,
my present should not shadow the past ,
and on each line cast a reforming eye ,
at peril of my life the eternal price i just paid <end_with_no_punc>
in the eastern plains for crown <end_with_no_punc>
and a single drop of water <end_with_no_punc>
and snatch'd her spirit from a world of woe .
but if thou canst not help a man <end_with_no_punc>
and stare on beauty till his senses drown ;
conviction to the serpent none belongs .
peace without justice is a low estate , -
and swore he never should return to jove .
in the scope of man’s diversity ,  is an indifference we can see ,
on her knees she prays ;
when a word would justify you <end_with_no_punc>
a nothing ,  a mere chance ,  oft gives him life again .
clumping down the sod ;
pretend not to know <end_with_no_punc>
for he’s clearing this bush of the dukite snakes .
wrapped in a curl of timeless ...  .
she melts in heart beating .
from you the wings of the song birds rose .
this bloody poetry writing - it's like rock-climbing -
make it go on around the world <end_with_no_punc>
till the trouble grew and stirred .
the clearest image of death :
there have been so many like u . s .
steal the labour of others to support <end_with_no_punc>
craft ,  faith and narrative all fuse ,
another tide flows in ,  another moon <end_with_no_punc>
i do now feel like a mere clown <end_with_no_punc>
will take care of things <end_with_no_punc>
and she did rest her soon ,  for it pleased god <end_with_no_punc>
i never meant to hurt you .
among the tasks of real life ,  hath wrought <end_with_no_punc>
quite palls the taste ,
the light that lit your lovley face ,
a girl was lying down flat on her back <end_with_no_punc>
from ones my soul <end_with_no_punc>
his brooding wings the spirit of god outspread ,
a friend in chicago finally <end_with_no_punc>
see on these ruby lips the trembling breath ,
she put on when it was cold <end_with_no_punc>
not be one more creep killing a girl <end_with_no_punc>
calm and serene autumn is strong gush of wind ,
but how bloated with meaning it is !
you love the day and place .
there was little chance of safety for the men who were below .
discord and warfare crush the mind ,
among the sharks that create terror and fear <end_with_no_punc>
love ships rustle in the <end_with_no_punc>
as ye shoot at the flying duck --
and rain pours forth ,  where sun has been .
who shall with soothing words accost <end_with_no_punc>
o'er-rule our modern ways ,
who improvise a play within the game .
you are one .  fly . '
had it been some bad smell he would have thought <end_with_no_punc>
in the muted house ,  one minute before <end_with_no_punc>
to feel moody or forlorn ,
paint shadows in imaginary lines ,
for they each have their own distinct worlds ;
upon the tyrant !  i will help ;  take gold :
to the headlands where he rested ;
it laughed at me <end_with_no_punc>
where poets still might dream the sun was drown'd :
on the dance that they fearfully lead .
each single day ,  to greet me !
 " to hear the merry-sounding reed :
for a guest  ( that )  has lodged on  ( my )  head nor did i honour  ( him )  .
the portrait of so heavenly hue to paint .
you'll do us a favor ,  so put that to your head ,
to beat and to beat <end_with_no_punc>
th' had got the very bride's good will ;
the usual cat .  if a crow <end_with_no_punc>
is mirth so tremendous a crime ?
hush ,  thrush !  hush ,  missen-thrush ,  i listen ...  .
spangle with twinkling dew the flowery waste .
like the thing that never knew the earth ,  never off roots <end_with_no_punc>
they threatened its life with a railway-share ;
as hunger gnawed at his belly <end_with_no_punc>
are thoughts ,  delighting in the golden change <end_with_no_punc>
in agony .  the cock under the thumb .
the chairs and benches now are set ,
the child it has been waiting for .
life unknown ,  stretches frozen .
'tis right his praises to proclaim ,
a stark moss-trooping scott was he <end_with_no_punc>
a stranger .  a thousand feet above the earth ,
'to the garden of bliss ,  thy seat prepared . '
 " nine inch will please a lady ,  "  to thickening silence .
and speak in public with some sort of grace .
with treads of memories ,
it fell in the year of mutiny ,
a lightning bolt thought <end_with_no_punc>
little do they know of your existence <end_with_no_punc>
and joy ringing out <end_with_no_punc>
therefore unto him hastily she goes <end_with_no_punc>
